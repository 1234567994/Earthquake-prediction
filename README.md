# Earthquake-prediction
Built a machine learning-based earthquake prediction model using historical seismic data to identify patterns and estimate the likelihood of future earthquakes. The project involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, and applying predictive algorithms to support early warning systems and disaster preparedness.
